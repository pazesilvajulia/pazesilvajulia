# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm JÃºlia Paz, a Systems Development Technician and Software Engineering undergraduate student.

I'm currently shifting my focus back to back-end development â€” mainly working with **Java**, but I'm also open to exploring other languages and technologies.

Currently learning and building with:
- Java & Spring Boot
- API development
- Database design & SQL
- Clean code principles

Always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and cool side projects ðŸš€
